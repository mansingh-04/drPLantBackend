🌿 DrPlant – Plant Disease Detection & Care Assistant

Dr Plant is an intelligent plant-care assistant designed to help users easily manage and nurture their plants. It solves common problems like forgetting watering schedules, missing early disease signs, and improper plant care by combining a Next.js frontend, Node.js/Express backend, PostgreSQL database, and Hugging Face AI model. Users can create plant profiles, upload images for species or disease detection, track watering and fertilization logs, and receive AI-powered care suggestions. The system includes secure JWT-based authentication, full CRUD operations for plants and logs, analytics dashboards, and seamless cloud deployment using Vercel (frontend), Render (backend), and Aiven PostgreSQL.
